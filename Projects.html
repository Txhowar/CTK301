  <section> <h2> Thylla and The Old Gods </h2>
  <p> This game was a project made with the Illinois State University Game Development Club in Fall 2021. This was great experience to work on as I have learned and created the art for the title screen, tilemaps, icons, UX/UI, story and more.  </p>

<section> <h2> Plunder The Present </h2>
<p> Plunder the Present was a platforming game about a pirate in the modern day. I helped create the idea and was part of making music for the game. I made use of my musical background and learned Ableton Live, a software where you can create and edit music. </p>

<section> <h2> Mage Rush </h2>
<p> Mage Rush is my first ever developed game created as a project for Game Development 240. This game allowed me to show the basics of Unity and C# in order to make a runner-like game similar to Temple Run or Subway Surfers. </p>
