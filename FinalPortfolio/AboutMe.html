    <h2> About Me </h2>

  <h3> My name is Trey Howard and I am from Chicago, Illinois. My creativity never seems to end and I express that through game design, music, writing and art. Most of this is mainly inspired by video games I've grew up with my whole life. In general, playing video games and watching other people play them via Youtube or Twitch were my main hobbies. I have played a variety of different types of games from AAA shooters, fighting, platformers to RPG,  strategy, etc.. This led me to eventually taking the opportunity my University provided to learn and become a game designer. </h3>

  <h2> My Goal </h2>
  <h3> I am in my junior year of college pursuing a Game Design Degree at Illinois State University. The Game Design curriculum has already provided important knowledge and experience I can take into the a game industry. Classes also include familiarizing myself in sound design, photoshop, Illustrator, Unity, HTML and C# outside of specifically game design. I hope to continue my study and gain more experience by working in the game industry field through a game studio.   </h3>
